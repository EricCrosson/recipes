* Cashew Chicken

** Ingredients
- 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts (about 4 pieces), cut into 1 inch pieces
- 3 Tablespoons Cornstach
- 1/2 tsp black pepper
- 1 Tbsp canola oil
- 1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce
- 4 Tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 4 Tablespoons ketchup
- 2 Tablespoons sweet chili sauce
- 2 Tbsp brown sugar
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 tsp grated fresh ginger
- 1/4 tsp red pepper flakes
- 1 cup cashews

** Directions
1. Combine cornstarch and pepper in resealable food storage bag. Add
   chicken. Shake to coat with cornstarch mixture.

2. Heat oil in skillet over medium-high heat. Brown chicken about 2
   minutes on each side. Place chicken in slow cooker.

3. Combine soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, sweet chili sauce sugar,
   garlic, ginger, pepper flakes, and cashews in small bowl; pour over
   chicken. (I like my cashews to be softer so I add them during the
   cooking process, if you want more of a crunch, add them right
   before serving)

4. Cook on LOW for 3 to 4 hours.

5. Serve over rice.

** Notes
We loved the recipe as is and many people do as well but here are some
different things you can try after some comments received.

- If it is too salty you can simply use low sodium soy sauce.
- If there isn't enough sauce, you can double the sauce or make it 1
  and 1/2 times.
