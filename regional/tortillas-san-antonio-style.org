* San Antonio-Style Flour Tortillas

** Ingredients

- 2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter
- 3/4 Cup of Milk
- 1 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil
- 2 Cups All-Purpose Flour, plus more for kneading
- 1 Teaspoon Baking Powder
- 1/2 Teaspoon Kosher Salt

** Directions

1. Place the butter and the milk into a pot on medium-low heat cook until
   butter has melted. Turn off the heat and stir in the vegetable oil.

2. In a bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt. Pour in
   the melted butter, milk, and oil and stir until a loose, sticky ball
   is formed. Place dough on a floured surface and knead for 2 minutes
   until the dough is firm and smooth. Stir until well combined. Cover
   the dough and let it rest for 1 hour.

3. After an hour, divide the dough into 8 pieces. Cover again and let it
   rest for 30 minutes. After the dough has rested, place each dough ball
   one at a time on a floured surface, pat it out into a 4-inch circle
   and then roll it out with a rolling-pin from the center until it’s
   thin, about 8-inches in diameter. Don’t over work the dough, or it
   will be stiff. Keep rolled out tortillas covered until ready to cook.

4. In a dry cast-iron skillet heated on high, cook each tortilla for 30
   seconds on one side, flip it, and then cook for 1 more minute on the
   other side. It should start to puff a bit. Flip it again and cook for
   30 more seconds. Place cooked tortillas in a basket lined with cloth
   or in a tortilla warmer. Repeat process for remaining balls of dough.
