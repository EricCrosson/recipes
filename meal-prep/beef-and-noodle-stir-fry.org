* Beef and Noodle Stir-Fry

** Ingredients
*** Sauce
- 3 Tbsp soy sauce
- 1 Tbsp water
- 1 Tbsp brown sugar
- 1-2 Tbsp chili garlic sauce, sambal, or sriracha
- 1 tsp sesame oil
*** Stir Fry
- 8oz. rice noodles
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 Tbsp grated ginger
- 1 Tbsp vegetable oil
- ½ lb. lean ground beef
- 1 carrot
- 3-4 green onions
- 1 crown broccoli
- 1 large handful mushrooms
- Handful fresh cilantro (optional)

** Directions

1. Cook the noodles according to the package directions, being careful
   to leave them al dente and not over cooked. drain the noodles in a
   colander and set aside.

2. Prepare the sauce by stirring together the soy sauce, water, brown
   sugar, chili garlic sauce, and sesame oil. Set the sauce aside.

3. Mince the garlic and grate the ginger. Use a large-holed cheese
   grater to grate the carrot (or julienne using a mandoline). Slice
   the green onions on a diagonal, separating the fleshy white
   portions from the green ends.

4. Heat the vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Once
   hot, add the ground beef, garlic, and ginger. Sauté until the beef
   is cooked through. Add the white portions of the sliced green
   onions and sauté for one more minute. Add the shredded carrots and
   sauté for one minute more (leaving the carrots slightly crunchy).

5. Cut the broccoli into reasonably-sized pieces and julienne the
   mushrooms.  Heat oil in a pan, when hot stir fry the broccoli and
   mushrooms.

6. Add the drained noodles, the prepared sauce, and the stir-fried
   vegetables to the skillet. Stir until everything is coated in sauce
   and any extra moisture has been absorbed by the noodles. Turn the
   heat off and top with the green portion of the sliced green onions
   and fresh cilantro leaves.
