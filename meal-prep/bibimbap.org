Bibimbap is traditionally served with Kochujang sauce. The recipe can
be easily found online. For the sake of convenience and time I
substitute this with Sriracha.

** Notes

Some recipes call for boiling vegetables. That’s the best method if
you’re going to eat this right away. However, I don’t suggest boiling
the vegetables if you are prepping. They will get extremely soggy
throughout the week.
